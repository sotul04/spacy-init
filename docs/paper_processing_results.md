## Source Paper

**Title**: "Attention Is All You Need In Speech Separation"  
**Authors**: Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli, Samuele Cornell, Mirko Bronzi, Jianyuan Zhong  
**Year**: 2021  
**Conference**: ICASSP 2021  
**Impact**: Introduced SepFormer, applying Transformer architecture to speech separation

## Abstract Text

```
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have long been the dominant architecture in sequence-to-sequence learning.
RNNs, however, are inherently sequential models that do not allow parallelization of their computations.
Transformers are emerging as a natural alternative to standard RNNs, replacing recurrent computations 
with a multi-head attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose the SepFormer, a novel RNN-free
Transformer-based neural network for speech separation. The Sep-Former learns short and long-term
dependencies with a multi-scale approach that employs transformers. The proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the standard WSJ0-2/3mix datasets. It reaches an SI-SNRi
of 22.3 dB on WSJ0-2mix and an SI-SNRi of 19.5 dB on WSJ0-3mix. The SepFormer inherits the parallelization
advantages of Transformers and achieves a competitive performance even when downsampling the encoded
representation by a factor of 8. It is thus significantly faster and it is less memory-demanding
than the latest speech separation systems with comparable performance.
